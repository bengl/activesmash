ActiveSmash is an ActiveRecord-esque layer on top of [MongoSmash](https://github.com/bengl/mongosmash). You'll love it if you love [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) or [Rails ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord). Also it's **really** small, since it defers most of its magic to MongoSmash.

I know, this is pretty sparse on documentation, but the source is so simple and the tests so clear that you'll figure it out in no time! Ok that's terrible of me. I'll make docs soon.

See LICENSE.txt, as it's probably important.
